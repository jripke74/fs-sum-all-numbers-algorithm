# fs-sum-all-numbers-algorithm

In this lab, you will design a sum all numbers algorithm. This algorithm takes an array of two numbers and returns the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them.

Design a Sum All Numbers Algorithm
In this lab, you will need to design a sum all numbers algorithm.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

1.  You should have a function named sumAll that accepts an array of two numbers.
2.  sumAll([n, m]) should return the sum of n and m plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first. For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.
